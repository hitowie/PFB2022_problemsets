# ============================

# move to /bin directory and list files
% cd /bin/
% ls

# What's the difference between these two commands?
% ls -l			# flag -l long list
% ls -lt		# flag `-t` sorts files by time modified

% man ls 		# let's you check the manual

# string multiple commands together with a pipe `|`
# STDOUT of first command is piped into STDIN of second command
% ls -lt | head

# string multiple commands together by `;` to run sequentially
# STDOUT is not passed on to next command
% date ; sleep ; date

% man sleep		# suspend execution for an interval of time

# use `wget` or `curl -O` to download file 'cuffdiff.txt'
% wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2022/master/files/cuffdiff.txt

# redirect STDOUT of command line into a file
% grep Chr7 cuffdiff.txt > fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt

# make sure to read and check the new file
% cat fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt		# read new file
% head fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt		# read first 10 lines of new file
% tail -2 fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt		# read last 2 lines of new file

# append STDOUT of command line to the end of file
% grep Chr9 cuffdiff.txt >> fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt
# make sure to read and check the edited file

# redirect STDERR to a file
% cat blablabla.txt
cat: blablabla.txt: No such file or directory
% cat blablabla.txt 2> errors.txt

# what happens when you try to redirect STDOUT?
% cat blablabla.txt > errors.txt
# STDERR is returned to the screen
# no STDOUT, file is empty

# redirect both STDOUT and STDERR to two separate files in one command
% cat fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt blablabla.txt 1> out.txt 2> err.txt
# this gives the same results
% cat fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt blablabla.txt > out.txt 2> err.txt
# both `>` and `1>` redirect STDOUT

# redirect both STDOUT and STDERR to the same file
% cat fav_chr_cuffdiff.txt blablabla.txt &> all_out_err.txt

# 2. what's the full path to your home directory?
% pwd
/Users/cheil

# 3. move up one directory
% cd ..
% pwd
/Users
# how many files does it contain? how many directories?
0 files	4 directories

# 4. make a directory called 'problemsets' in your home directory
% cd ~
% mkdir problemsets

# 5. navigate into this new directory called problemsets
% cd problemsets/
# verify you're in the correct directory
% pwd

# 6. download the file 'sequences.nt.fa' into your problemsets directory
% wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prog4biol/pfb2022/master/files/sequences.nt.fa

# 7. without using a text editor, use unix commands to find the following qualities for the file 'sequences.nt.fa'
# 7.a how many lines does the file contain?
% wc -l sequences.nt.fa 
148 lines
# 7.b how many characters?
% wc -m sequences.nt.f
10267 characters
# 7.c what's the first line of the file?
% head -1 sequences.nt.f
>NM_001126114.2 Homo sapiens tumor protein p53 (TP53), transcript variant 3, mRNA
# 7.d what are the last three lines?
TTTATAGCTGTTGGAAGGACTAGGTCTTCCCTAGCCCCCCCAGTGTGCAAGGGCAGTGAAGACTTGATTG
TACAAAATACGTTTTGTAAATGTTGTGCTGTTAACACTGCAAATAAACTTGGTAGCAAACACTTCCAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
# 7.e how many sequences are in the file?
% grep '>' sequences.nt.fa | wc -l		# search for '>' in file and pipe STDOUT `wc -l` to count lines
2 sequences

# 8. rename sequences.nt.fa to cancer_genes.fasta
% mv sequences.nt.fa cancer_genes.fasta

# 10. perform the following on file 'cuffdiff.txt'
# 10.a look at the first few lines of the file
% head cuffdiff.txt
# 10.b sort the file by log fold change 'log2(fold_change)' from highest to lowest and save STDOUT to a new file 'sorted.cuffdiff.out'
% sort cuffdiff.txt -k10 -r -g > sorted.cuffdiff.out
# 10.c sort the file by log fold change, save only the first 100 lines to a new file
% sort cuffdiff.txt -k10 -r -g | head -100 > top100.sorted.cuffdiff.out 
# 10.d create a list of the top 100 genes with the largest change in expression:
# sort the file by log fold change, take the top 100, and print only the first column, sort by gene name and remove duplicates
% sort cuffdiff.txt -k 10 -g -r | head -100 | cut -f 1 | sort | uniq > differentially.expressed.genes.txt
